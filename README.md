**noleaker** is a free, open-source browser extension for Chrome and Firefox (Manifest V3) that sends your browser through a
SOCKS5 proxy and stops the usual leaks: WebRTC, DNS, QUIC, timezone and language. Think of it as a
FoxyProxy alternative that also makes the browser look like it is in the proxy's country.

No account, no license key, no servers of our own.

## What it does

| Leak                | How noleaker handles it                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **IP and DNS**      | All browser traffic and DNS lookups go through your SOCKS5 proxy. |
| **WebRTC**          | Limited to proxied UDP, so pages cannot read your real IP.        |
| **QUIC / HTTP3**    | Upgrades are prevented, so traffic stays on the proxy.            |
| **Timezone**        | `Date` and `Intl` report the timezone of the proxy's country.     |
| **Language**        | `navigator.language` and `Accept-Language` follow your choice.    |
| **Geolocation**     | Reports a point in the exit country, not your real position.      |
| **Proxy goes down** | Kill switch: requests are blocked instead of going out directly.  |

Also included:

- **Built-in leak test** that checks each item above and tells you which setting fixes a failure.
- **Audit this tab**: see what the current site really reads from your browser.
- **Per-site whitelist**, manual overrides (timezone, locale, coordinates) and settings import/export.
- **Optional fingerprint shields** (off by default): canvas, audio and layout noise, WebGL, screen, CPU.
- **Two privacy modes.** _Strict_ (default) sends everything through the proxy. _Compatibility_ lets
  Iran-hosted sites (bundled list of about 127,000 domains) and your own direct domains skip it.

## Install

**Chrome**

1. Download `noleaker-chrome-<version>.zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/LordVersA/noleaker/releases/latest) and extract it.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the extracted folder.

Needs Chrome 120 or newer. Other Chromium browsers are untested.

**Firefox**

1. Open `noleaker-firefox-<version>.xpi` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/LordVersA/noleaker/releases/latest) in Firefox and click
   **Add**. It is signed by Mozilla (not listed on addons.mozilla.org) and updates itself.
2. Recommended: `about:addons` → noleaker → **Run in Private Windows** → Allow. Without it,
   private windows are not protected and the icon shows a **PW!** badge.

Needs Firefox 140 (ESR) or newer on desktop. Forks such as LibreWolf probably work but are untested.

## Use

1. Popup → **Manage proxies** → add your SOCKS5 host and port.
2. Back in the popup, switch **Protection** on. The pill shows **Proxy verified**.
3. Click **Run leak test** to check IP, DNS, WebRTC, QUIC, timezone and language.

## Troubleshooting

- **Everything is blocked, icon is red:** the proxy is unreachable. Start your SOCKS5 server; it
  recovers within a minute. Options → Diagnostics shows what happened.
- **"noleaker does not control the proxy":** another extension (for example FoxyProxy) or a policy
  owns Chrome's proxy settings. Disable it.
- **PW! badge (Firefox):** noleaker may not run in private windows, so they are not protected.
  Allow it in `about:addons` → noleaker → Run in Private Windows.
- **Firefox with `privacy.resistFingerprinting`:** the fingerprint shields switch themselves off,
  because Firefox already handles them. Timezone and language spoofing stay on.
- **A site shows your real timezone:** check that the site is not whitelisted, then reload the page.
- **WebRTC calls do not work:** expected. Browsers cannot carry UDP through SOCKS5, so WebRTC is
  restricted to protect your IP.

## Limits

- **Not a VPN.** Only browser traffic is covered, and the proxy operator sees where it goes.
- **SOCKS5 username/password only in Firefox.** Chrome's proxy API cannot carry them, so Chrome
  needs a proxy without authentication.
- **"Proxy verified" is not a guarantee of zero leaks.** It means the browser controls were applied
  and read back. Independent packet capture has not been done yet.
- **Not an anti-bot tool.** Spoofing removes obvious mismatches; it does not make you undetectable.
- Cookies and logins survive proxy changes. Use a separate browser profile to keep identities apart.

## Build from source

```sh
npm install
npm run build     # typecheck + production build to dist/chrome/ and dist/firefox/
npm run build:chrome   # one target only (also build:firefox)
npm run dev       # watch mode with source maps (dev:firefox for Firefox)
npm test          # run after a build
npm run socks     # local SOCKS5 server on 127.0.0.1:1080 for testing
npm run package   # build and zip both targets to release/
```

Load the `dist/chrome/` folder with **Load unpacked**. For Firefox, run `npm run start:firefox`, or
open `about:debugging` → This Firefox → **Load Temporary Add-on** and pick
`dist/firefox/manifest.json`. After a rebuild, reload the extension and your open tabs. Testing, releases and design notes: [docs/DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md) and
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).
